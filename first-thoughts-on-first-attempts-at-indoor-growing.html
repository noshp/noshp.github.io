<b>I started trying to grow Basil and Spinach in my tiny condo in Feb 2018.</b>
<br>
My relevant experience included some brief work in a greenhouse in Maine, and another in Montreal. Neither really taught me what I need to know for these experiments.
<br>
The goals include:
<ul>
	<li>Grow greens to grab gratuitously</li>
	<li>Dont develop dirt dependance</li>
	<li>Automate anything arduous or annoying</li>
</ul>
<br>
In other words: 
<blockquote><i>The dream is to have a self growing, dirt-free, indoor garden.</i></blockquote>
</p> 
So far...
<br>
<ul>
	<li>I still need to tweak my growing method, specifically the amount of lighting, the temperature at germination for my spinach, and the nutrients I give to older seedlings</li>
	<li>I also want to track variables like temp and humidity to learn about my grow space</li>
	<li>If I start growing in a tub, I would like to automate a pump to refill it when its levels get low... or at least have something tell me the levels are low</li>
	<li>Finally, I would like to put a camera over the plants and track NDVI over time... this is the tallest ask</li>
</ul>

<i>
The <b style="font-size:110%">big</b> dream is to make a mini greenhouse that I would build this summer and use to grow cold-weather plants in the winter out on my patio in the winter.
</i>
